# discovery phase

this is the first real phase of the orchestration.
in this step i will figure out, what scripts to run, and what variables to compile.

pre-work, find files, env filtering, name filtering -> discoverItem

self-note: IF pre-scripts are added to this system, i think they will be invoked within this phase (kinda like beforeDiscovery in pester)
